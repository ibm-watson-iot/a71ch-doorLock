## Device code for _NXP i_._MX_ Platform with IC A71CH Secure Element

This project contains source for device client for NXP A71CH Enabled Door Lock demo
Application.

## Prerequisite

combination of *MCIMX6UL-EVKB* and *A71CH* boards. Complete the steps described in 
the following GitHub project:

[IBM Watsonâ„¢ IoT Platform C Client Library - For _NXP i_._MX_ Platform with IC A71CH Secure Element](https://github.com/ibm-watson-iot/iot-nxpimxa71ch-c)

## Build and Install Door Lock demo application client

Use the following steps to build the application client:

* Create a directory named "doorLock" in iot-nxpimxa71ch-c directory.
* Copy contents of this directory in "doorLock" directory.
* Use the following commands to build and install the demo application client.

```
make -C doorLock build
make -C doorLock install
```

```
cd doorLock
bash startDoorLockClient.sh
```

This script performance the following tasks:

* Retrieves Secure Element UID
* Sends a registration request to the provisioing service provided by Door Lock Demo Application running in IBM Bluemix.
* Download client configuration data from provisioing service.
